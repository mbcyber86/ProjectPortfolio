# ProjectPortfolio
# This portfolio is just a culmination of the things that I have learned and/or taught myself as I begin my journey into the CS industry.
# With almost 10 years of Marketing experience I am ready to take on the challenge of learning programming languages and ways to be more safe and secure on the interwebs.
# My current goals are to start in an entry-level role. I am still deciding which route I want to take but I am willing to give anything a try.
